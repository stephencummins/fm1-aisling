"""The bar along the top of every page of AISLING's site, and what goes in each page's head: written once, here.
A page carries the two marks, once each (<!--AISLING-HEAD--> last in its head, so web/brand/site.css comes after the
page's own style, and <!--AISLING-BAR--> first in its body); tools/make_pages.py and tools/manual_html.py fill them.
The links between the pages are relative, so each place the site is served from is whole in itself, and every page names
its home at SITE as its canonical address. The visualiser fetches nothing, so it has its own copy of the harp
(tools/make_brand.py) and of this bar: a change here goes there too, and tools/make_pages.py stops if they differ.

AISLING runs on three things, so the site has three parts, PRODUCTS, and its root chooses between them. The bar has a
switch between the three (the page's own filled), then the page's part's nav: NAVS[part]. The root belongs to none of
them and has the nav every part shares, COMMON. The FM-1's pages are where they always were (emu/, install/, manual/ ...)
so the links already out there still work; only its landing page moved, to fm1/."""
