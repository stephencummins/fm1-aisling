## What?

AISLING turns the M-VAVE FM-1 into a generative Irish ambient instrument: harps and a flute over a held drone,
in the old modes, with the weather of the west coast behind them. It plays itself from the moment it's switched
on, and it never ends. You can play with it: the white keys give you the flute, always in the piece's scale, and
it answers you. (An *aisling*, said "ash-ling", is an Irish vision poem.)

It is a fork of [NACHTFAHRT](https://github.com/FartyPants/fm1-nachtfahrt), FartyPants's Berlin School firmware.
AISLING keeps NACHTFAHRT's whole machine (its five layers, its arc, its slowly moving filters, its lead that
remembers and answers) and changes what it plays:

- **the harp**: NACHTFAHRT's plucked string restrung as a wire-strung harp, with a long, bright ring. It plays
  every piece's Sequence and, an octave down, its Sequence 2, like the harper's other hand;
- **the flute**: a soft tone, breath, and a chiff as each note starts, leading in every piece;
- **the modes**: major, Mixolydian, Dorian and minor, and two gapped scales of six notes (one with no seventh,
  one with no sixth), in the pipes' and the whistle's keys (D, G, A, E, B);
- **the double tonic**: the chords swing between two, D and C or E minor and D, a long while each, as the old
  tunes do;
- **the jig's threes**: harps of 12 and 9 steps, with every third step accented;
- **eight pieces** named for places in the west and for a harper;
- three of the black keys' effects named in Irish: **Ceo** (fog), **Macalla** (an echo) and **Fras** (a burst
  of rain);
- a green triskele on the launch screen and the main page.

**Status: 0.1, a first test version** (see [the releases](https://github.com/stephencummins/fm1-aisling/releases)).
It runs on the FM-1, installed from the [web installer](https://stephencummins.github.io/fm1-aisling/install/), and
in the [browser emulator](https://stephencummins.github.io/fm1-aisling/emu/), from the same code.

**Saved pieces.** AISLING saves its eight pieces in the same place in the FM-1's memory as NACHTFAHRT, DUB-1 and
AMB-1. It doesn't read what they saved (it starts with its own eight recipes), and its first save, a few seconds
after you change something, replaces theirs; they ignore AISLING's in the same way and replace it when they save.
Installing another firmware may lose what AISLING saved. AISLING uses no samples.

## The pieces

| # | Piece | Named for | Key, tempo | What you hear |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Skellig | Skellig Michael, off Kerry | D minor, 76 | An organ drone, one harp in a jig's threes, the surf; Dm and C in turn |
| 2 | Burren | The Burren, Clare | G major, 84 | A choir, two harps of 12 and 11 drifting apart, the wind |
| 3 | Aran | Inis Mór | A Dorian, 96 | A reed drone, a jig's 12 over a slip jig's 9, a turf fire's crackle; Am and G in turn |
| 4 | Carolan | Turlough O'Carolan, the harper | D major, 88 | Strings, two harps of 16 and 15, rain, a planxty's chords |
| 5 | Blasket | The Blasket Islands, Kerry | E Dorian, 70 | A choir, slow harps, the flute's slow air over the surf; Em and D in turn |
| 6 | Samhain | The year's dark turn | B minor, 64 | A low, beating organ, one low harp, a low flute, the wind |
| 7 | Connemara | Bog, lake and rain | G hexatonic minor, 92 | An organ, a slip jig's 9 over 8, rain; Gm and F in turn |
| 8 | Tir na nOg | The land of the young, over the western sea | D hexatonic major, 80 | A phased glass drone, two harps, a long reverb; D and G in turn |

The keys, modes and tempos are starting points, tuned by ear. The flute's themes are its own: no air is quoted.

## In short

| | |
|---|---|
| White keys | Play the Lead (the flute), in the piece's scale (the key it sounds is lit) |
| Black keys | Eleven effects, each while held (lit; dark while held): Ceo, Macalla, Fras, Repeat, Shimmer, Freeze, Octave, Return, then Rise, Close, Transpose (in PERFORM: the solos) |
| PLAY · REC · EDIT | Play / rest · a tap: hold (the echo repeats what it holds), held: the effects grid (16 effects on the white keys) · a tap: the Chords page, held: the next chord |
| SEL | PERFORM: the knobs Filter, Wet, Energy, Sweep; white 1–5 mute the Drone, Sequence, Lead, Sequence 2, Atmosphere; black 1–5 solo them; white 6 held: the levels; white 7–11 held: Sweep, Open, Shut, Drop (both sequences out), Echo; the top key (G): the Lead forgets its ideas and its theme. Held: Lock |
| HOME | The Aisling page (Filter, Evolve, Motion, Drift); again, the Key page (Tempo, Root, Mode, Transpose) |
| ENV | The Drone (Pedal, Reso, Phaser, Attack); again, its sound (Colour, Release, Reverb, Echo); again, its Move page (Width, Time, Rate, Intro) |
| ARP | The Sequence (Density, Octave, Length, Grid); again, its sound (Cutoff, Decay, Reverb, Echo); again, its Repeats (Repeat A, A time, Repeat B, B time); again, its Move page |
| LFO | The Lead (Phrases, Octave, Glide, Vibrato); again, its sound (Tone, Attack, Reverb, Echo); again, its Move page |
| SEQ | Sequence 2 (Chance, Octave, Length, Level); again, its sound; again, the Pattern page (write the steps on the keys); again, its Move page |
| SAVE | The Atmosphere (Density, Width, Drift, Air); again, its sound (Colour, Ring, Reverb, Echo); again, its Move page |
| FX | Space (Echo, Echo time, Feedback, Reverb); again, the Echo page (Blur, Tone, Width, Size) |
| GLO | Setup (Tune, MIDI out, Lights, Save); again, the Arc (Lead in, Bridge, Arc, Memory). Held: save; held on: the piece back to its recipe |
| ALGORITHM | On a layer's page, its voice (the Atmosphere: its character) |
| PRESETS | The piece |
| SELECT | On a layer's pages, its level; on the Aisling page, Energy (elsewhere nothing) |
| OCT− / OCT+ | On the Sequence's, the Lead's and Sequence 2's pages, its octave (lit while it's above or below where the piece was loaded) |

The [manual](docs/MANUAL.md) has the rest; the [cheat sheet](https://stephencummins.github.io/fm1-aisling/cheat/)
is this table on one page, to print.

## Building and testing

The toolchain is the same as NACHTFAHRT's and DUB-1's (see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) and [EMULATOR.md](EMULATOR.md)):

```
tests/run_tests.sh      # the engine, the platform pieces, the app in a simulator, the web builds
web/emu/build.sh        # the browser emulator: build/emu (serve it, open index.html)
./build.sh              # build/amb.fwsc, for the FM-1
python3 tools/fm1_install.py build/amb.fwsc     # install it over USB
```

`build/host/amb_host SCRIPT OUTDIR` runs the whole app on a computer from a script
(`tests/scenarios/*.amb`), with audio and screenshots coming out; `build/host/en_render OUT.wav SECS piece=N`
renders the engine alone. `tools/make_card.py` draws the harp on the card ([docs/card.png](docs/card.png)).

## Credits

AISLING is by CU_STE ([www.stephen8n.com](https://www.stephen8n.com)). It is a fork of
[NACHTFAHRT](https://github.com/FartyPants/fm1-nachtfahrt) by FartyPants (GPL-3.0-only): the engine, the layers,
the arc, the filter motion, the remembering lead, the pages, the effects grid, the emulator and the site come from
there. NACHTFAHRT is a fork of [DUB-1](https://github.com/sbegueria/fm1-dub), a fork of
[AMB-1](https://github.com/charlesvestal/fm1-amb) by Charles Vestal (GPL-3.0-only): the echo chain, the plate,
the pieces system, the chord walk, the UI and the platform come from there. The reverb is Jon Dattorro's plate
("Effect Design, Part 1", JAES 1997), as in [FoMni-1](https://github.com/charlesvestal/fm1-fomni); Shimmer's
octave shifter follows OCT UP and its SHIMMER in [Felucca](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca)'s performance layer
(Leo Kuroshita, Hügelton Instruments; also in [Skiff](https://github.com/illuminus5/skiff)); the Drone's Choir
follows VOICE in Felucca (`eng_formant.c`, GPL-3.0; Klatt's cascade; its vowel table, after Hillenbrand et al.); the
granular cloud (Freeze) follows the design of CLOUD in [JIANT](https://github.com/juanjiant-bit/JIANT) (GPL-3.0);
the Harp's string follows `pluck.c` in M-VAVE's [fm1_open](https://github.com/m-vave/fm1_open) (after DaisySP's
String, Electrosmith and Emilie Gillet; MIT); Wind's pink and Surf's brown noise and Rain's drops follow NOISE in
[Skiff](https://github.com/illuminus5/skiff) (`eng_noise.c`, Leo Kuroshita, Hügelton Instruments; GPL-3.0; Paul
Kellet's pink filter); the Tape atmosphere is DUB-1's crackle, after Bahadirhan Kocer's "Using Resonators in Live".
NACHTFAHRT's way of playing a sequence (the root accented, sparse notes, a dotted-eighth repeat as loud as the
note, two delays), which AISLING's harps keep, owes much to Synth Seeker's videos on Berlin School sequencing. The
platform (hardware layer, USB, update loader, storage, installer) is [Felucca](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca)'s
by Leo Kuroshita (Hügelton Instruments), by way of [X0X](https://github.com/charlesvestal/fm1-x0x), FoMni-1, AMB-1,
DUB-1 and NACHTFAHRT. The idea of running FM-1 firmware in the browser comes from
[Groove OS](https://www.groove-os.com/). GPL-3.0-only; see [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md).
